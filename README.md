# 🚀 My DSA Journey  

Welcome to my **DSA Journey Repository**!  
This is where I document everything I learn about **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** – from the ground up.  

## 📌 What you’ll find here  
- My step-by-step **DSA learning journey**.  
- Different **patterns** I explore while solving problems.  
- **Why** I apply a specific pattern in a problem.  
- My **thought process** while approaching each problem.  
- Complete explanations from **A → Z** in simple language.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
I created this repo to:  
1. Track my growth and consistency in DSA.  
2. Share my problem-solving approach with the world.  
3. Help others who are also learning DSA and want to understand **not just the “what” but also the “why & how.”**  

## 🛠 Tech / Languages  
Most solutions will be in **C++** (sometimes other languages if I experiment).  

## 🤝 Contributing  
This is mainly a personal learning repo, but if you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or drop your thoughts!  

## 📖 Notes  
- This repo is not just code – it’s my **thinking notebook**.  
- I’ll be writing in the most **simple and beginner-friendly way** possible.  

Stay tuned and happy coding! ✨
